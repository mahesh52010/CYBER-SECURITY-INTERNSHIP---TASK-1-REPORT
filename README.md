This repository presents a comprehensive security testing report for a sample web application using **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**. The goal was to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities in a controlled lab setup to better understand web security threats and countermeasures.

### 🔍 Report Highlights:
- ✅ **SQL Injection** – Extracted user credentials and schema details.
- ✅ **XSS Attacks** – Explored Reflected, Stored, and DOM-Based XSS.
- ✅ **Brute Force Simulation** – Cracked weak authentication using Burp Suite.

🧠 **Skills Practiced:** Ethical hacking, penetration testing, Burp Suite, HTTP analysis  
🛠️ **Environment:** Kali Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Burp Suite
